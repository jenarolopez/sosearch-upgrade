Welcome to the React Native App Name! This mobile app is built using React Native framework, which allows you to develop cross-platform apps for both iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase.

## Getting Started

Before running the app, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)) installed on your machine. Once you have installed them, you can follow these steps to run the app:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the development server.
4. Open a new terminal window and run `npm run android` or `yarn android` to launch the app on an Android emulator or device. Alternatively, you can run `npm run ios` or `yarn ios` to launch the app on an iOS simulator or device.
